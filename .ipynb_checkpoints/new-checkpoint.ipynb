    "Word Vectors nowadays are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, language translation, sentiment analysis, etc. The goal of word embedding methods is to derive a low-dimensional continuous vector representation for words so that words that are syntactically or semantically related are close together in that vector space and thus, share a similar representation.\n",

    "For this part we will use the Sanders Analytics dataset to create embeddings. Since the other dataset is large we might run into memory problems.<br><br><br>\n",
    "Although we can directly use word representation based on word co-occurance matrix directly it is generally not a good idea to do so for the following reasons:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The word co-occurance matrix scales with vocabulary size, considering memory constraints this would be problematic for large datasets, as in the IMDB data set that has vocabulary size after remove stop words of 225109, which requres rougly around 189 GiB of storage capacity(roughly 203 GB)</li><img src=\"memoryerror.png\">\n",
    "    <li> The word co-occurance matrix will be quite sparse, meaning many entries in the matrix will be zeros. This is problematic due the fact that for many nlp tasks the multyplication operation is used quite frequently, e.g. for word similarity task, cosine similarity is used:<img src=\"cosine-equation.png\"> Here we can see the dot product is computed between two word vectors, multyplication with zeros wastes precious computation power and your time.</li>\n",
    "    <li> High co-occurance counts for stop words and conjunctions offset true representation of words, meaning thier could become a dominant factor when these embeddings are used in computations. These also dont provide a lot of information as thier counts with other words would also be high.</li>\n",

    "In summary, you want to avoid sparse represenation's just like the corona virus.<br>\n",
